# Demo Skills Framework

Minimal framework for registering and executing skills. Includes example
skills for detecting, locating and unscrewing screws as well as a simple
`DismantlingPlanner`. A tiny runtime with CLI support persists data via a
miniature `di.base` database which can be inspected using `dimonta db show`.
